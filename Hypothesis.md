# Hypothesis-Testing

## Chi Square

 

Non parametric test

Chi square is of 2 types,

1. testing goodness of fit

2. test of independence of 2 variables

 

We test chi square using 2 categorical variables.

 

Ho: There is No significant difference between variables

H1: There is Significant difference between variables

 

## T test

 

To test the significance of the difference of the mean values.

Sample size should be small, sample size < 30

 

·       One sample T test

To compare sample mean with that of the Population mean

We test one sample T test using one continuous variable, the full data will be our population and for testing one sample t test we take a sample from the population and test it.

Example: A school with 1500 students is our population and a class with 60 students is our sample. And here we test their ages to check its mean is similar or not

 

·       Two sample T test

To compare means of two different samples.

we test two sample T test using two continuous variables,

Example: To compare 2 classes, Class A and Class B, compare their mean ages

 

·       Paired T test

To test is there any significant difference in a paired sample

Example: weight 1 indicates the weight of kids in a school. Weight 2 is the weight of the same kids after years.

 

## Z test

It is used to determine whether the means are different when the population variance is known and the sample size is large, sample size > 30

 

·       One sample Z test

to compare sample mean with that of the population mean

we test one sample Z test using population mean of a continuous variable and sample mean of same variable

Example: A school with 1500 students is our population and a class with 60 students is our sample. And here we test their ages to check its mean is similar or not

 

·       Two sample Z test

two compare means of 2 different samples.

We test Two sample Z tests using 2 different continuous samples.

Example: IQ levels for 20 individuals from each city, to test the mean IQ level is significantly different between the two cities.

 

## F test/ Anova

 

The F test is used to test if the variances of two populations are equal.

We test the F test using two continuous variables.

 

H0: Variance of first population is equal to variance of second population

That is, σ12   = σ22

H1: Variance of first population is not equal to variance of second population

That is, σ12  ≠   σ22

 

The statistical technique used in ANOVA is F test

There are two kinds of questions arrives in ANOVA

 

1.       One way classification of data

2.       Two way classification of data

 

One way classification of data: observations are classified on the basis of a single criterion.

Two way classification of data: observation are classified on the basis of two criteria
